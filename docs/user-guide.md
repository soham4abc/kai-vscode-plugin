# Kai VSCode Extension
## IDE Builds
We provide built versions of the IDE plugin as a `vsix` file in the [kai-vscode-plugin/builds](/builds) directory.  We recommend you download the latest version available.

## Pre-requisite
1. Ensure you can run [Kantra](https://github.com/konveyor/kantra) locally
2. Install [Kai](https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/kai) backend

### Ensure you can run Kantra locally

* See [Kantra Installation Guide](https://github.com/konveyor/kantra?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) or if you can follow how we run from the [kai](https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/kai) project

* In [kai](https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/kai) we have a few scripts to help with installing Kantra and running an analysis.

  1. Ensure podman is running (for MacOS we need to run a podman VM): [samples/macos/restart_podman_machine.sh](https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/kai/blob/main/samples/macos/restart_podman_machine.sh)
  1. Fetch the Kantra binary, we will download it from a container image: [samples/macos/get_latest_kantra_cli.sh](https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/kai/blob/main/samples/macos/get_latest_kantra_cli.sh)

- You can run the below scripts to run an analysis from the `kai/example` directory:

  1. `git clone https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/kai.git`
  1. `cd kai/example`
  1. Fetch source code to run analysis against via: [./fetch.sh](https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/kai/blob/main/example/fetch.sh)
     - Will clone a git repo of the sample [coolstore](https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/coolstore) app
  1. Will run Kantra to analyze the previously cloned source repo: [./analyze](https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/kai/blob/main/example/analyze.sh)

- It is important that Kantra is able to run successfully on your machine before you proceed with the IDE extension. It will need to do a similar step of running Kantra from inside of the IDE.

### Setup Kai (backend)

* See [KAI Installation Guide](https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/kai?tab=readme-ov-file#demo-pre-requisites)


## IDE Plugin Installation Methods

You have a choice of installing the `vsix` file from the VSCode GUI or direct from the command line.

### Using Command Line (alternative installation method)

Only follow these steps if you decided to skip installing from the UI side and you want to install from CLI.

1. Install `vsce` by running `npm install -g vsce` in your terminal.
2. Install the .vsix file with the following command:
   ```bash
   code --install-extension path/to/your-extension.vsix 
    ```
3. Restart/reload VSCode.

# Using the IDE Plugin

### Get a Demo App

1. Clone the Cool-store application:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/coolstore.git
    ```
1. Ensure you have the  [Kai](https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/kai) project setup and cloned, you will need access to the [custom_rules](https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/kai/tree/main/samples/custom_rules) for the demo app
2. Navigate to File > Open in VSCode and locate the folder we just cloned.

### Running Kantra Analysis

1. Navigate to the KAI plugin in VSCode.
![configuration-feature](images/configuration-feature.png)
2. Set the configuration parameters as shown below:
- Input: path to coolstore app
- CLI: `kantra`
- Target: `containerization`, `jakarta-ee`, `jakarta-ee8+`, `jakarta-ee9+`, `quarkus` (if your target is unavailable, click "Add", type your target, and hit enter)
- Rules: Navigate to the path [custom_rules](https://github.com/konveyor-ecosystem/kai/tree/main/samples/custom_rules)
3. Click the `Run` button to start the analysis.
4. Wait for the analysis to complete successfully (expect about 2-3 minutes).
